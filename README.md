# Candidate Decider Version 3
The algorithm used to decide who can be admin on the UEA CS-Paper 98 discord
The new GUI can be used to import and export to the text file and refresh the page via the menu bar

Key things to know about the selection system:
1. The more competition there is, the more admins will be selected
2. The better the competition is, the harder it is to become admin
3. All candidates are treated the same so there is no point in complaining about a rigged election
